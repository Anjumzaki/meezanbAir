                            Hungary is a relatively large country in Central Europe and has been a desired vacation destination for a long time.
                              Before travelling you need to know that Hungary is a member of the Schengen Area Agreement, 
                              so if you do require a visa, you need a Schengen visa.

                             At the moment, it is not possible to apply online for a Schengen Visa so you need to check for all availabe Embassy and Consulate places in your country in order to apply.
                              In the case that you are planning to visit more countries with one Schengen Visa you need to submit your application for your visa at the embassy of the country you visit first.
                              So, if you plan to go to Italy and then to Hungary, the visa that you get from the Italian embassy grants you entry in Hungary as well.
                              Primarily, this is all basic information.
